You cant make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
Strike while the iron is hot
Dont bite the hand that feeds you
Dont put all your eggs in one basket
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest
Many hands make light work
Honesty is the best policy
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence
Dont judge a book by its cover
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
Rome wasnt built in a day
Actions speak louder than words
Its no use crying over spilled milk
If you scratch my back Ill scratch yours
Learn to walk before you run
Dont bite off more than you can chew
Dont make a mountain out of an anthill
Always put your best foot forward
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
A rolling stone gathers no moss
